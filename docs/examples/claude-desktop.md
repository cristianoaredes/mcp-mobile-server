3. Installs APK using appropriate tool
4. Captures screenshots at key app screens
5. Provides test results summary and build artifacts info

### **Performance Analysis**

**Prompt:**
```
"Help me analyze the performance of my Flutter app. Build a release version, install it, monitor logs for 60 seconds, and tell me about any performance issues."
```

**Claude Process:**
1. Builds optimized release version
2. Installs on physical device (if available)
3. Monitors logs with performance-focused filtering
4. Analyzes log output for performance warnings
5. Provides optimization recommendations

## üîß Configuration Best Practices

### **Enhanced Configuration**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mobile-dev": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@cristianoaredes/mcp-mobile-server"],
      "env": {
        "LOG_LEVEL": "info",
        "NODE_OPTIONS": "--max-old-space-size=4096"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Environment Variables:**
- `LOG_LEVEL`: Control server logging (error, warn, info, debug)
- `NODE_OPTIONS`: Increase memory limit if needed

### **Multiple Configurations**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mobile-dev": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@cristianoaredes/mcp-mobile-server"]
    },
    "mobile-dev-local": {
      "command": "node", 
      "args": ["/path/to/mcp-mobile-server/dist/server.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Use Cases:**
- `mobile-dev`: Stable NPM version
- `mobile-dev-local`: Development/custom version
